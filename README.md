--As a savvy developer I want to work from a mobile-first approach so that my site will take less time to develop across multiple platforms and display sizes.

--As a hiring manager I want to see that the site responds well to variations in media and display environment as a result of Nathan's coding decisions.

--As a user I want to be able to refer to Nathan's portfolio from any device or display if needed.

--As a hiring manager or other potential partner I want to see a full gamut of Nathan's coding experience and knowledge demonstrated in the projects exhibited.
